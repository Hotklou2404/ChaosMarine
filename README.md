# ChaosMarine
A mod for Enter The Gungeon that adds a new custom character for you to play with.

## Features
For more information about the loadout and stats of the Chaos Marine, tips and tricks for playing him and some lore about where he came from, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Hotklou2404/ChaosMarine/wiki).

## Installation
1. If you haven't done so already, download and install the latest version of [ModTheGungeon](https://github.com/ModTheGungeon/ETGMod.Installer/releases/latest/download/ETGMod.Installer.exe).
2. Run Enter The Gungeon once. It should generate a subfolder in your ETG install directory called Mods.
3. If you haven't done so already, download the latest version of [Kyle's Custom Characters Mod](https://modworkshop.net/mod/24802) and extract the contents of the `.zip` into the Mods folder in your ETG install directory.
5. Delete the `mods.txt` file inside the Mods folder and run Enter The Gungeon once. It should generate a subfolder in your ETG install directory called CustomCharacterData.
6. If you haven't done so already, download the latest version of [Retrash's Custom Items Collection](https://modworkshop.net/mod/25197) and extract the contents of the `.zip` into the Mods folder in your ETG install directory.
7. Download the latest version of [Chaos Marine](https://github.com/Hotklou2404/ChaosMarine/releases/latest) and extract the contents of the `.zip` into the CustomCharacterData folder in your ETG install directory.
8. Lastly, delete the `mods.txt` file inside the Mods folder again and then you're good to go.

### Falling Helmet Retexture Addon
To install, simply download the `.zip` file, extract its contents into `Enter the Gungeon\Resources\sprites` and click yes to override. Remember to make a backup of the original files so that you can easily revert it back to normal if you wish.

What is it and what does it do? Usually no matter what your character looks like, as long as they have the Marine as their base they will have a blue helmet drop off their head and onto the floor when they lose their armor. With this addon the helmet that falls of your character's head is now the same color as Chaos Marine's helmet.

Notice: It will also affect the color of the helmets that fall off all Marine-based characters's heads, whether you be Chaos Marine, the actual vanilla Marine or any other custom character with the Marine as their base. If you have this installed while you are playing as Chaos Marine, it will look perfect. But if you play as any other Marine-based custom character, or as the vanilla Marine himself, it will probably look weird and out-of-place.

## Additional Notes
* What's the difference between the normal version and the alternative version of the mod? The only real difference is that the alternative version has a scar over his one eye, while the normal version does not. This is purely cosmetic, and has no impact on gameplay whatsovever. Note that the "normal" version has been removed in later versions of the mod and the "alternative" version renamed so there's only one file now.
* Chaos Marine is in many ways just a reskinned Marine with altered stats and a different starting loadout. This is partly because he is themed around being an alternate reality version of the Marine. It is also because I am still pretty crap at pixel art and am not yet able to make a decent looking character from scratch.

## Credits

* Thank you Ysterklou. It was you who came up with the original idea for this character so long ago and let me use it.
* Many thanks to all the people who have been giving me feedback and suggestions. You guys have helped me a LOT with fine-tuning this custom character's stats and loadout.
* And lastly, a big thanks to everyone who have been playing this custom character mod! I hope you all enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.
