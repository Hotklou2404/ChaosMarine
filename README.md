# ChaosMarine
A mod for Enter The Gungeon that adds a new custom character for you to play with.

## Installation
1. If you haven't done so already, download and install the latest version of [ModTheGungeon](https://github.com/ModTheGungeon/ETGMod.Installer/releases/latest/download/ETGMod.Installer.exe).
2. Run Enter The Gungeon once. It should generate a subfolder in your ETG install directory called Mods.
3. If you haven't done so already, download the latest version of [Kyle's Custom Characters Mod](https://modworkshop.net/mod/24802) and extract the contents of the `.zip` into the Mods folder in your ETG install directory.
5. Delete the `mods.txt` file inside the Mods folder and run Enter The Gungeon once. It should generate a subfolder in your ETG install directory called CustomCharacterData.
6. If you haven't done so already, download the latest version of [Retrash's Custom Items Collection](https://modworkshop.net/mod/25197) and extract the contents of the `.zip` into the Mods folder in your ETG install directory.
7. Download the latest version of Chaos Marine and extract the contents of the `.zip` into the CustomCharacterData folder in your ETG install directory. Be sure to pick either the normal or the alternative version - not both.
8. Lastly, delete the `mods.txt` file inside the Mods folder again and then you're good to go.

### Falling Helmet Retexture Addon
To install, simply download the `.zip` file, extract its contents into `Enter the Gungeon\Resources\sprites` and click yes to override. Remember to make a backup of the original files so that you can easily revert it back to normal if you wish.

What is it and what does it do? Usually no matter what your character looks like, as long as they have the Marine as their base they will have a blue helmet drop off their head and onto the floor when they lose their armor. With this addon the helmet that falls of your character's head is now the same color as Chaos Marine's helmet.

Notice: It will also affect the color of the helmets that fall off all Marine-based characters's heads, whether you be Chaos Marine, the actual vanilla Marine or any other custom character with the Marine as their base. If you have this installed while you are playing as Chaos Marine, it will look perfect. But if you play as any other Marine-based custom character, or as the vanilla Marine himself, it will probably look weird and out-of-place.
